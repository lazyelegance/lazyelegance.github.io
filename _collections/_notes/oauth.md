What is OAuth?

OAuth is an authorization framework that allows third-party applications to obtain limited access to user accounts on an HTTP service. It works by delegating user authentication to the service that hosts the user account, and authorizing third-party applications to access the user's information.

OAuth is a standard protocol for authorization that allows users to grant third-party applications access to their data without sharing their passwords. It is widely used in modern web applications, including social media platforms, email services, and cloud storage providers.

OAuth 2.0 extends the OAuth protocol to support mobile and web applications, non browser applications, and server-to-server applications.
