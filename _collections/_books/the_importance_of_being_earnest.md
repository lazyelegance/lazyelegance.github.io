#### Some highlights

> “**::I hope, Cecily, I shall not offend you if I state quite frankly and openly that you seem to me to be in every way the visible personification of absolute perfection.::**”

> “The very essence of romance is uncertainty. If ever I get married, I’ll certainly try to forget the fact.”

> “Oh! it is absurd to have a hard and fast rule about what one should read and what one shouldn’t. More than half of modern culture depends on what one shouldn’t read.”

> “You have always told me it was Ernest. I have introduced you to every one as Ernest. You answer to the name of Ernest. You look as if your name was Ernest. You are the most earnest-looking person I ever saw in my life. It is perfectly absurd your saying that your name isn’t Ernest.”

> “**The truth is rarely pure and never simple**.  Modern life would be very tedious if it were either, and modern literature a complete impossibility!”

> “True.  **In matters of grave importance, style, not sincerity is the vital thing.** ”
