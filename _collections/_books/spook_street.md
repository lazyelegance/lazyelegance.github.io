#### Some highlights

> *“When you lived on Spook Street you wrapped up tight: watched every word, guarded every secret. ”*

> *“Been confiding in you, has he, **young Double-Oh Three-and-a-Half**?”*

> *“So. We have what I believe our American chums call a sit-u-a-tion..... ”*

> *“All political lives end in failure, someone once said. Spooks’ lives, too, held more to regret than to cherish, a conclusion it was hard to ignore once the light drained from the day. ”*

> *“I’m not even sure where Ho got that ice from. Right now, we’re all in the dark.” The snap of a lighter disproved his point, and for a moment Lamb’s face was visible. Catherine coughed. The lighter died, but Lamb’s cigarette tip glowed red. ”*
