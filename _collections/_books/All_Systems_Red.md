#### Some highlights

> “We had an environmental system, but no air locks, as the planet’s atmosphere was breathable, just not particularly good for humans for the long term. **I don’t know why, because it’s one of those things I’m not contractually obligated to care about.**”

> “Confession time: I don’t actually know where we are. We have, or are supposed to have, a complete satellite map of the planet in the survey package. That was how the humans decided where to do their assessments. I hadn’t looked at the maps yet and I’d barely looked at the survey package. In my defense, we’d been here twenty-two planetary days and I hadn’t had to do anything but stand around watching humans make scans or take samples of dirt, rocks, water, and leaves. **The sense of urgency just wasn’t there. Also, you may have noticed, I don’t care.**”

> “I thought it was likely that the only supplies we would need for DeltFall was the postmortem kind, but you may have noticed that **when I do manage to care, I’m a pessimist.**”
