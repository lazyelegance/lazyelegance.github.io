Part of the Bookety Book Books Top 100 2025/26 challenge.

#### Some highlights

> *"In my mind are all the tides, their seasons, their ebbs and their flows."*

> Birds are not difficult to understand. Their behaviour tells me what they are thinking. Generally it runs along the lines of: Is this food? What about this? This might be food. I am almost certain that this is. Or occasionally: It is raining. I do not like it.

> The Beauty of the House is immeasurable; its Kindness infinite.
