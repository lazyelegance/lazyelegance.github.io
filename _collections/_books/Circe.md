#### Some highlights

> *“The generals take the credit, of course, and indeed they provide the gold. But they are always calling you into their tent and asking for reports of what you’re doing instead of letting you go do it. The songs say it is heroes. They are another piece. When Achilles puts on his helmet and cleaves his red path through the field, the hearts of common men swell in their chests. They think of the stories that will be told, and they long to be in them. I fought beside Achilles. I stood shield to shield with Ajax. I felt the wind and fan of their great spears. Those soldiers, of course, are yet another piece, for though they are weak and unsteady, when they are harnessed together they will carry you to victory. But there is a hand that must gather all those pieces and make them whole. A mind to guide the purpose, and not flinch from war’s necessities.”*

> *“Even the best iron grows brittle with too much beating.”*

> *“Daedalus did not long outlive his son. His limbs turned gray and nerveless, and all his strength was transmuted into smoke. I had no right to claim him, I knew it. But in a solitary life, there are rare moments when another soul dips near yours, as stars once a year brush the earth. Such a constellation was he to me.”*

> *“We named him Telemachus after my skill with the bow.” Distant fighter, it meant.”*

> *“Yet, as strange as it sounds, even in such extremities of misery I was not wholly miserable. I was used to unhappiness, formless and opaque, stretching out to every horizon.”*

> *“I had asked Odysseus: “What did you do? When you could not make Achilles and Agamemnon listen?”*
> *He’d smiled in the firelight. “That is easy. You make a plan in which they do not.”*

> *“I thought: I cannot bear this world a moment longer. Then, child, make another.”*

> *“I have a better idea. I will do as I please, and when you count your children, leave me out.”*

> *“You are wise,” he said.*
> *“If it is so,” I said, “it is only because I have been fool enough for a hundred lifetimes.”*

> *“*We are sorry, we are sorry."  
>"*Sorry you were caught," I said. "Sorry that you thought I was weak, but you were wrong."*

> *“But in a solitary life, there are rare moments when another soul dips near yours, as stars once a year brush the earth. Such a constellation was he to me.”*
