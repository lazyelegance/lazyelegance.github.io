#### Some highlights

> The sail was patched with flour sacks and, furled, it looked like the flag of permanent defeat.

> He did not say that because he knew that if you said a good thing it might not happen.

> "Fish," he said softly, aloud, "I'll stay with you until I am dead."


> "I'll just steer south and west," he said. "A man is never lost at sea and it is a long island."

> The old man's head was clear and good now and he was full of resolution but he had little hope. It was too good to last, he thought. 

> He hit it without hope but with resolution and complete malignancy.

> "But man is not made for defeat," he said. "<mark>A man can be destroyed but not defeated.</mark>"
