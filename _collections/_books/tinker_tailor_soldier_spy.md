#### Some highlights
>
> It's the oldest question of all, George. **::Who can spy on the spies?::**

> The more identities a man has, the more they express the person they conceal.

> “There are always a dozen reasons for doing nothing," Ann liked to say--it was a favourite apologia, indeed, for many of her misdemeanours. <mark>"There is only one reason for doing something. And that's because you want to."</mark> Or have to? Ann would furiously deny it: coercion, she would say, is just another word for doing what you want; or for not doing what you are afraid of.

> there was no future: there was only a continued slide into still more terrifying versions of the present.

> Reason as motive, or reason as logic, or reason as a way of life?
